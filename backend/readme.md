Perfect! Let’s write a **README.md** for your project that includes **setting up a virtual environment**, **activating it (using fish shell)**, and **installing dependencies**. I’ll also include a note about using Homebrew’s Python installation.

Here’s a **recommended README.md** template:

---

````markdown
# Project Name

A brief description of your Flask app (e.g., "A Flask API server for XYZ feature").

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.13 (installed via Homebrew)
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)
- (Optional) Homebrew

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo/backend
```
````

---

### 2️⃣ Create a Virtual Environment

Create a local virtual environment inside your project directory:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

---

### 3️⃣ Activate the Virtual Environment

#### For fish shell:

```fish
source venv/bin/activate.fish
```

#### For bash/zsh:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Your shell prompt will change to show `(venv)` — indicating you’re now using the local Python environment.

---

### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 5️⃣ Run the Flask Server

Make sure the virtual environment is activated, then run:

```bash
python3 -m flask run
```

By default, Flask will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- **Homebrew-managed Python** is marked as "externally managed" (PEP 668). That’s why using a virtual environment is **highly recommended** instead of installing system-wide packages.
- If using VSCode, make sure to select the interpreter from the virtual environment (`.venv/bin/python`).

---

## 🛠️ Additional Tips

- To deactivate the virtual environment:

  ```bash
  deactivate
  ```

- To install new packages:

  ```bash
  pip install package-name
  pip freeze > requirements.txt
  ```

If you'd like, I can customize this further—like adding project-specific info, routes, or API docs. Just let me know! 🚀
