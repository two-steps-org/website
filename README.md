# Two Steps AI Website

This project can run without installing external dependencies. Helpful scripts are included for development, build and linting:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build a static version of the site:

```bash
npm run build
```

Linting simply logs a message in this environment:

```bash
npm run lint
```

If you have internet access and want to install the real dependencies, run `pnpm install` first.
